Chapter Two: Super Squirrel Sandy

	Sandy the squirrel had been born albino. Her fine white fur reflected light more brightly than that of a polar bear, her teeth more capable than any carnivore of gnawing through nuts at the speed of sound.
	When she was young, her nestmates had made fun of her for her fur, but as she grew older, Sandy learned that her genetic uniqueness made her a rock star of Macalester College, capable of extracting pizza from the hands of students and professors alike with just the slightest carefully given ponderous look.
	Sandy used this to her advantage, reselling the pizza – a major cause of squirrel heart conditions – for nuts, accumulating an enormous sum of nuts which she reinvested in the squirrel market, planting her proceeds and literally growing money on trees.
